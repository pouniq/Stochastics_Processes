# Stochastics_Processes
studying Stochastic Processes in fourth Term of university opened my eyes to possibilities and power of Random walks and Branching Processes , ... i want to convert theories that i learned and turn into Python code to better my understanding and simulate each event for sake of simulation.


## Random walks
i model 2 version of the same problem first 1D-simulation (need to work on it) and second 2D-simulation that is completed and i really understand what a Random is , that code was intersting and mind blowing at most

## dice rolling :
that was cool too
